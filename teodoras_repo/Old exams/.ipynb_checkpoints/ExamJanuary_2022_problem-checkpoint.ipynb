    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",

    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "* I (Benny) will visit the exam room at around 10:30 to see if there are any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",

    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",

For example, if we enumerate the cities according to alphabetical order, the first city `'Aracaju (SE)'` would correspond to $0$. Each row of the file corresponds to one flight, i.e. it has a starting city and an ending city. We model this as a stationary Markov chain, i.e. each user's travel trajectory is a realization of the Markov chain, $X_t$. Here, $X_t$ is the current city the user is at, at step $t$, and $X_{t+1}$ is the city the user travels to at the next time step. This means that to each row in the file there is a corresponding pair $(X_{t},X_{t+1})$. The stationarity assumption gives that for all $t$ there is a transition density $p$ such that $P(X_{t+1} = y | X_t = x) = p(x,y)$ (for all $x,y$). The transition matrix should be `n_cities` x `n_citites` in size.\n",
