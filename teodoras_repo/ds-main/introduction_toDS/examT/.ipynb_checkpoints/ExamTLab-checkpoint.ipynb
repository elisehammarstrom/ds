    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",

    "A courier company operates a fleet of delivery trucks that make deliveries to different parts of the city. The trucks are equipped with GPS tracking devices that record the location of each truck at regular intervals. The locations are divided into three regions: downtown, the suburbs, and the countryside, however there is always the possibility the truck breaks down and it goes to the workshop. The following table shows the probabilities of a truck transitioning between these regions at each time step:\n",

    "4. What is the stationary distribution? Furthermore it it reversible? (Explain your answer) [3p]\n",
    "5. Advanced question: What is the expected number of steps it takes starting from the Downtown region to first reach the Workshop? Hint: to get within 1 decimal point, it is enough to compute the probabilities for hitting times below 50. Motivate your answer in detail [4p]. You could also solve this question by simulation, but this gives you a maximum of [2p].\n",
