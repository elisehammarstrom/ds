Introduction to DS

## Likely to show up on the exam:

### Train-test splits

### Markov Chains

### Subgaussian and subexponential

### Risk

### Regression
In various fields, the term "residual" can have different meanings, but in the context of statistics and regression analysis, a residual refers to the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and the value predicted by the regression model. It represents the part of the dependent variable's variation that is not explained by the independent variables included in the model.
1) Observed Value (Actual Value): This is the actual value of the dependent variable that you have observed or measured.
2) Predicted Value: This is the value of the dependent variable predicted by the regression model based on the values of the independent variables.
3) Residual: The residual is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value. Mathematically, the residual (e_{i}) of the i-th observation is calculated as follows:
   e_{i} = Observed value_{i} - Predicted value_{i}
In a regression analysis, the goal is to build a model that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. This method is known as least squares regression.

Covariance matrix: 
Covariance: the degree of where the, say two variables, go together. If one is really positive where the other is really positive, and one is really negative where the other also is really negeative, then they have a high degree of covariance. If one has a really high positive value, and the other really low negative value, then they have a negative covariance. 
Covariance and correlation are very very similar, even up to their mathematical formulations. Correlation is bounded between -1 and 1 whereas covariance is not necessarily bounded between -1 and 1. The covariance matrix has all variables as rows and all variables as columns.
